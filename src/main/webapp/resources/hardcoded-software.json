The biology of Ae. aegypti is described with great detail on the previously developed CIMSiM model (Focks et al., 1993). Skeeter Buster additionally includes a detailed genetic component, and can therefore model the genetics of Ae. aegypti populations, making it a crucial tool in the evaluation and development of genetic control strategies.",
